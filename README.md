# Motion-Imitating-Robotic-Arm

In this project, I have created a robot arm that works with mimic logic using Arduino. The main aim of the project is to create a robot arm that can learn specific movements and then repeat them.

## Tools Used in the Project

- Arduino Uno
- Breadboard
- 2 buttons
- 4 servo motors
- Jumper cables
- 4 joystick module

# Project Structure

The project is built using 2 buttons and 4 servo motors. When the first button is pressed, the robot arm records the movement. There are a total of 4 different movement options. When the second button is pressed, the robot arm repeats the previously recorded movements.

## Code File

The Arduino code file used in the project can be found under the name "robot_arm.ino". This file contains all the necessary code for the project to work.

## Using the Project

To use the project, first upload the Arduino code to the Arduino board. Then, use the buttons to teach the robot arm the movements. After the learning process is completed, you can make the robot arm repeat the learned movements by pressing the second button.
